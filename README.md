# portfolio

## Description

The motivation of this project was to create a place where I can showcase my work as a developer in a portfolio website. The main "why" of this project is to begin the process of building a portfolio website to showcase my current work and to also act as ongoing project to add on to as I grow as a developer. This project solves the lack of a portfolio that I did not have to showcase work that is going to be completed as I grow in this industry. Within the start of this project alone, I learned (as a complete novice in this industry) - there is a lot of trial and error, you will have to do some research, and sometimes you need to take a break to solve your problem.
